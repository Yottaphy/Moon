This poster was presented as part of the Poster Session in the Finnish Physics Days, a national conference for physics in Finland. 

The poster displays the status of the MARA-LEB facility up to March 2021. In particular, a study of the recoil distribution at MARA's focal plane from the data collected in experiment M17 at JYFL.
